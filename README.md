# covid-x-ray-classification

<p>
  For this project, different architectures were used to characterize patients with COVID, Neuomonia and healthy patients.
</p>

The purpose of this work is to make a reliable system to identify COVID-19 patients through transfer learning in convolutional neural networks.

For this project we implement the pre-trained VGG architectures in Tensorflow
